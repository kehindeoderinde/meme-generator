# Meme Generator

In this project, I use Python to develop a CLI tool and Flask application to generate memes

## Overview

At a high-level, this program reads data from different file types (CSV, TXT, JSON, PDF), converts that data into structured QuoteModel, combined with images generated by our MemeEngine to generate memes and save to disk path provided.

## Built With

* [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask): Simple web server interface
* [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas): Easy processing meme text from csv files
* [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow): Image processing to add text

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

`pdftotext` binary is required and can be installed...
* On Ubuntu 20.04
  ```sh
  sudo apt install poppler-utils
  ```

##Installation

1. Make sure Python is installed on local system.
2. `pdftotext` binary is required and can be installed...
* On Mac using Homebrew
  ```sh
  brew install pkg-config poppler python
  ```
* On Windows (Currently tested only when using conda)
    * Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools
    * Install poppler through conda:
    ```sh
    conda install -c conda-forge poppler
    ```
3. Install python dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Using the CLI

```sh
$ python main.py --help
usage: main.py [-h] [-p PATH] [-b BODY] [-a AUTHOR]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PATH, --path PATH  Path to and image file.
  -b BODY, --body BODY  Body or Content written to image.
  -a AUTHOR, --author AUTHOR
                        Author name written to image.
```
Or run the default options **```python main.py```** to create a meme in ```./tmp```

## Using the Flask app
Starting dev server
```sh
$ flask run
 * Serving Flask app 'app' (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Once started(using the default port) go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
